# Something Awesome Project
For extended security engineering: COMP6841
app2.py is a chat application developed in Python that operates without any encryption, which exposes it to significant security risks, including unauthorized access to sensitive information. On the other hand, app.py utlizes RSA encryption, which provides security for communication. This encryption method ensures that even if messages are intercepted during transmission, the content remains protected and unreadable to unauthorized people. By utilizing RSA encryption, app.py effectively safeguards confidential information, making it more secure than its non-encrypted app2.py.
